## Retrospective Notes

- Jamie

  - Hopes that the professor and TAs will recognize the work we have done as a group on this project. In terms of the project, we are at a good place.

  - Feels like we have made good progress
  - Believes the pipeline will be useful, although hasn’t used it that much

- Ashley

  - This class has been okay. Wants experience with projects
  - Learning a lot about web development, HTML, CSS, Javascript
  - Want a good grade, but a cool app would be even better. Thinks we should all work towards that.
  - Nothing in particular to improve on
  - Enjoy what she has done so far. Favorite task was the CSS design and the task list logic with javascript. Didn’t have prior experience with that stuff, but learned a lot.
  - Work was definitely recognized.
  - Thinks we’re in a good place with our progress
  - Haven’t learned how to use the pipeline, but wants to learn to use it

- Arela

  - Getting what she expected from the class and project
  - Learning about web dev and working in a team.
  - Hadn’t used web dev languages, but now getting a lot of experience
  - Want a good grade, but also something she could show others and be proud of
  - One thing she wouldn’t change is the meetings. We’ve been assigning stuff well. Very productive. Leaves us in good place.
  - Work is recognized.
  - Working with others will really be a good skill, and something she wants to learn
  - Favorite task is the javascript, but had a lot of fun implementing other people’s designs in CSS
  - Thinks we’re keeping up
  - Went through pipeline documentation, but wants to learn how to do that.

- Dhanush

  - In terms of this class, it’s been fine. It’s not a great class, not a bad class. Lot’s of disorganized parts. Lot’s of things are assigned on Friday due on Sunday.
  - Happy that everyone contributes to the project. Happy everyone shows up and participates
  - Hope to get experience with team software engineering. Coding is different in a team.
  - Getting stuff together takes work.
  - End goal is good grade, but also something that is done and we can show to the rest of the class
  - One thing that could be improved, could’ve gotten moving a bit quicker. Still a good chunk of work to get done.
  - One thing that I don’t want to change, don’t want to change the way we do work week to week. Like the way we break things into tasks. Going week to week
  - Feels good about work done so far. Might have done more, but hindsight is 20-20. Has enjoyed work so far. Coordinator is an interesting position. Been fun.
  - Learning useful skills. The biggest thing was the CD/CI Pipeline. That stuff will probably be useful
  - Favorite task was the CI/CD Pipeline, no least favorite.
  - Maybe a little behind on progress. Should be fine by next weekend.
  - Thinks the pipeline is good. Should be helpful for testing.

- Ivan

  - Am getting what he wants out of the class. Prior to the class, had no javascript experience.
  - Also getting JS experience out of the project. Also how to work in a team. Having his work mean something.
  - Previously just designed something visually and had everyone else do the work.
  - Wants a good grade, but also wants a project he can show off to people.
  - Not much to be improved in the project. Going pretty well. Good pace, good work getting done. Not much to change there.
  - Feel good about the work he’s done. Very passionate about it, and nice to have people critique and compare it to other people’s.
  - Think that his work has definitely been recognized.
  - Have been learning useful skills about designing for other people, and doing stuff for others.
  - Feel good about the progress as a team. Think we’re keeping up. Not sure where other teams are. But considering how much time we have left, we’re making good progress
  - Favorite task is design. Project gives him a chance to improve what he’s been doing a lot of. Nice to apply his skills to something else.
  - No comments on pipeline, hasn’t used it much

- Haley

  - For this class its going okay so far. Lectures are kind of boring, but the team work is fun.
  - Grade, but mostly want a product that she could share with friends or family
  - Like that we’re working in groups. Most PAs are nothing like that. More than just personal input on the project.
  - Good learning experience to work in teams
  - Don’t see any clear improvements. Moving slow, but we’re not backtracking at any point. It’s only been forward progress.
  - Like the work she’s been doing so far. Can understand the work she does.
  - Likes the CSS the most. Challenging, to do, but satisfying. Had to do lots of exploratory programming to figure out what to do.
  - Got skills with HTMl and CSS and javascript. Much more interactive than previous projects
  - Feels like we’re working at a great pace. Once we have a single page, we’ll have a lot better idea of what to do.
  - For the pipeline, updated the npm, but stylelint didn’t seem to do anything when it was run.

- Jonathan

  - In terms of the class, doing alright with the class. Different experience from what he has had before, in terms of coding with a team and with Github. Doing coding projects alone before. Different and interesting to learn everything.
    - Like this exact experience of learning to code with people.
  - In terms of the project, Going well personally. Pushing to learn things more in depth than would have alone.
  - Given confidence to do some stuff on his own.
  - Since starting to work with other people, wants to learn how to mesh personal code with other people’s code. Will need to work with a lot of other people’s code. Adapting to how other people code
  - End goal to get a good grade, but also want a product he can show to other people. Like it to be a pretty good product. Not app store ready, but don’t want to be ashamed of it.
  - Enjoying how the project has gone so far. Like the way tasks have been assigned.
    - had been worried about how visual design would be or how code would be meshed, but we’ve covered that in the meeting
  - Things have been going in a good direction.
  - Looking back on the first design, could have done more. Had wrong expectations about what he would be doing. A lot of the design was in his head, but never really put it down in visual form for other people
  - Really enjoying the CSS for the last task. Interesting working on HTML and Javascript as well.
  - Feels like his work has been recognized.
  - Progress as a team has been good. Hit a bit of an obstacle this week, so this was a really important meeting. Moving from prototyping to getting something concrete. This meeting solidifies what we’re doing, and should allow us to make good progress moving forward.
  - Haven’t seen a need for the pipeline so far

- Brian
  - Like this class because of the web development that he hopes to gain out of the class
  - This project specifically, learning to work with other people is a good skill to have.
  - Pace of the project is good. Previous weeks we made progress while other teams were only talking about what to do.
  - Like the team. Everyone is doing their job. Him missing didn’t halt things. People went way further than he thought.
  - Hoping to gain development skills of using HTML and Javascript
  - Don’t really care about the grade. Just want to finish a good product. We have most of the basic stuff already. Just need to start implementing our dream goals about the coloring and the pomodoro stuff.
  - We’re in a good place. Doesn’t think we’re far behind. Not finished, but we’re ahead
  - Feeling like he’s lacking a bit since he missed a week.
  - Want to finish the tasks he was assigned.
  - Stuff done so far has been interesting, nothing too dull
  - His work has been recognized, like other people using his timer. Nice to see. Usually him asking other people for help, so nice to see other people relying on his code.
  - Learning useful skills about communication and seeing other people’s code.
  - Favorite task was implementing the code and the functions. Least favorite task has been trying to style them. Art isn’t usually his favorite subject. Don’t always know how to code in a visual way. Does it in a functional way.
  - Got most of the product done
  - Think the pipeline looks interesting. Didn’t know we had much to test for the app. Pull requests look useful
