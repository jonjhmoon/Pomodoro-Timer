# 1/16 Meeting Notes

## Meeting Outline

- Greeting each other
  - Go around and say name, year, college, and where they're from
    - Choose a get-to-know-you question:
      - What have you thought about CSE 110 so far?
      - Did you get a favorite present over the holidays?
      - What do you consider your strengths or weaknesses on a team?
  - Sadly Jonathan wasn't able to make it
  - We'll be discussing future meeting times in a moment
- Add everyone to the github!
  - Collect usernames in zoom chat
  - Can add them to the repo while we move on to discuss the team name
- Discuss team name
  - Any ideas would be appreciated!
- Discuss future meeting times
  - Right now on the when2meet there isn't a single time which works for everyone
  - In an effort to make it so we can all meet we should reevaluate what times we can meet going forward
  - It would be very helpful for us to all be a bit more generous with our time, so that we aren't excluding anyone from being able to participate
  - Even making an obscure time available might give us more options
- Spend 5-10 minutes updating the when2meet
  - Look at options for future meetings
  - Vote on when to meet in the future
- Discuss first set of assignments
  - Due Wednesday at midnight, so we need to get moving
  - There are four of them, and unfortunately none are arbitrarily easy. They'll all take some work
- Kickoff Meeting
  - We're already doing it, yay!
- Group Bonding Event
  - Ideas: Codenames, Among us, Jackbox
  - Hour long group activity
  - Can hold after the meeting, or schedule soon
  - Could try to hold now, but meeting will go long
  - Need to submit a screenshot of us doing it
- Group Page
  - Need to make a group page on Github Wiki or Github Pages
    - Should have our team "theme" or "brand"
    - Should have roster
    - Should have a link to each of our personal Github pages
  - Also need a team video
    - 2.5 minutes long
    - Introduces all of us
    - Does anyone have experience with video editing or recording?
    - Could just do a quick recording in Zoom now, if people wanted to
- Group Contract
  - A document with two things:
    - Definition of what is expected to be on the team
    - Definition of how to address situations where group "rules" are not being followed
  - Need every member to upload a signed PDF of the rules to the repo
  - They suggest figuring out the rules in a rules.md document in our kickoff meeting
- That's a lot of stuff...
  - We'll need to get started
  - We'll need to divide and conquer with this
