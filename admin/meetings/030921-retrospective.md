## Retrospective Notes

- Jamie
  - I’m hoping to be done with the class at this point. I enjoy working on the project in a team with everyone, but the class itself has dragged on a long time. I’m kind of tired of the lectures and the assignments.
  - In terms of the project, I’m enjoying it. I’m glad that we’ve made so much visible progress and that it shows. I’m happy that we’ll be ending the assignment with a solid pomodoro web app.
    - I was hoping to get a working product out of our project, and that’s definitely what we have. We have something I could see myself using without complaints, and that’s pretty cool.
    - My end goal for the project is to complete the stat tracking to a degree that it doesn’t seem unfinished. I think the rest of the page is in a state I’m happy with.
    - One thing that could be improved in the project is that we could’ve gotten some testing done earlier. The testing was really helpful for finding and addressing bugs, and I think it would’ve been cool to have access to it earlier.
    - One thing I wouldn’t want to change about the project is the way that we’ve all been able to contribute to it and add to the app.
  - I’ve felt good about the work I’ve done. I know I’ve done a lot to keep the project on track and moving. I’m glad that everyone else feels ownership of the project and makes an effort to participate and complete their work.
    - I’ve enjoyed working with everyone, but completing some of the assignments has been pretty boring. Making different videos and ticking off checklists isn’t the most engaging.
    - I feel like my work has been recognized in that people are willing to ask me questions or bring up any issues they’re running into. It’s validating to feel like people count on me
    - I’ve definitely been gaining useful leadership experience. This is definitely the most active and sustained leadership role I’ve had
    - My favorite task is the work review. I love seeing what everyone’s done on the project. My least favorite tasks are the class assignments
  - I feel great about our progress as a team. We’ve hit the finish line and we’ve accomplished what we set out to do. Just a few small pieces left and everything will be complete.
  - I feel like we’re right on time with wrapping everything up. I think a week less would’ve been too little, and a week more would’ve been too much
- Dhanush
  - In terms of the class, I think it’s a useful and important class, but personally, I wasn’t a fan of the way it was taught. So, I’m ready to finish this class, but I do think I’m getting what I want out of it, because I’ve learned a lot about software engineering that I didn’t know about.
  - In terms of the project, I think we’re in a good spot and hopefully we’ll wrap it up very soon. I think it’s been fun and I’ve learned some things by being a coordinator for the team, as I expected to.
  - My end goal is the same as it was at the end of the last sprint. I want a good grade in the class, but I also want to have a completed app that works well and something we can be proud of.
  - One thing that could be improved in the project is having consistency in our code, but I don’t think this is a big deal. Since different people worked on different parts of the app, the code is a little disorganized.
  - One thing I don’t want to change about the project is our development process, as we have a good flow of setting tasks for everyone for each week and getting them done.
  - I’m happy with the work that I’ve done. Especially in this sprint, I’ve had a chance to work with the code more which has been fun. I think my work has been recognized, as has everyone else’s, because we’ve all contributed equally.
  - I think I have been learning useful skills, as I’ve gotten to be a coordinator and understand what it takes to succeed in such a position and have everything working smoothly.
  - My favorite task is probably just working with git to make sure all the code is merged correctly. And for least favorite, I’d probably say writing test cases using Jest, because it doesn’t suit our project well and is very difficult to work with. There are also other options that are better, like Cypress, but we’re too short on time.
  - I’m happy with our progress as a team, since we’re almost done. I was a little concerned if we would be able to get everything done, but our work this sprint was great.
- Arela
  - I am getting what I want out of the project and the class. I really liked that we were able to work on different tasks alone and together. I’m happy with how much we have gotten finished together as a team.
  - End goal: It would be really nice to get a good grade and an end product that I would be able to use and be proud to show others.
  - Although I got to work with html, css, and js. I’ve worked mostly on the javascript for settings and the timer recently, and I’ve been enjoying it and learning a lot. Working on the custom settings allowed me to work on things that I wasn’t really familiar with. Also I’m glad we used GitHub for the project since I didn't get to really use it before.
  - My favorite task is working on the custom settings and getting it to work properly with the timer.
  - I think we’re either ahead or keeping up. We’re really close to a finished product but just have a few things to adjust/fix.
- Ashley
  - In terms of the class, I think I’m doing fine and I’m getting what I want since I’ve obtained the experience of working on a team project.
  - In terms of the project, I feel I’ve learned a lot of useful web development skills as I hoped for. I also learned how to use github in this process.
  - For the end goal, I think it would be great if we can get a good grade, and it would be even better if we have a cool app.
  - I’ve enjoyed what I’ve been doing. Specifically, my favorite task is the implementation of task list logic and its local storage. As I worked on these tasks, I got a much better understanding about Javascript and applied what I’ve learned in the labs.
  - I think we are keeping up. We have most core features for our app and just need to fix a few things and enhance it a little. Although we might not be able to implement everything, I think what we have is pretty good.
- Brian
  - I have learned a lot from the labs and the project in terms of the class, from the html elements to the teamwork. The lectures have been stimulating for some days but lacking for others. I think overall, it had been a good experience, especially meeting new people to work with rather than friends.
  - In terms of the project, I really enjoyed creating a new concept and learning using useful techniques. And to have been able to work with others. However, my own performance hasn’t been the best since the quarantine and it has affected this team. Since I cannot call this project my own, I do still want to be able to eventually create my own project with the skills I learned from this team and project building. The team has been really accepting and really enjoyable to work with. I really respect that our team has consistently got tasks done, and everyone owns up to their mistakes and to take up any new challenges. I think the team as a whole, I don’t think we could have done anything differently since our skills varied and we all needed to do some exploratory coding to see what best fits the project standards.
  - I learned a lot from the team. I learned about an environment of how a team may be in the future. I learned a lot from others’ perspectives and how standards should be set. I really enjoyed seeing my timer come into fruition and seeing others use my code to build on it. I am new to most of the elements taught in the course, like Javascript, HTML, and CSS, so being able to see how a traditional website can be built using both my techniques and other people’s technique is interesting to see.
  - I think the team has been on a good pace. In the beginning, we did a lot of exploratory coding which let us produce a strong prototype in the beginning. I think as the quarter went on, we all became busy and it was hard to complete the tasks we were assigned, but we did not fall too far behind. Our mob programming and small meetings to ensure our projects meet standards have been important to finishing the project. Even if we ended the project as of right now, I think we have a usable product to present to other groups. Perhaps, not the most
- Haley
  - In terms of the class, I liked that the goal is for students to have the opportunity to work with other students to experience what teamwork would be like in the field. Some lectures provide great insights for what to expect while others were somewhat tedious.
  - In terms of the project, I am looking forward to our group having a complete website that is working and that I can share with others. I got the opportunity to work with html, javascript, and css and have a better understanding of how to use these tools together. I would like a good grade at the end as well since I have put in a lot of effort to learn/do exploratory coding for this project. I think our group is doing well with how we approach breaking up the project. Everyone is always on task and seeks help when necessary. It’s a very inclusive working environment. One thing that we could have done better was with our approach to the design of the website in the beginning. I think we all should have decided on a design right from the beginning so it was clear to everyone in the group how each element in the website would interact with each other.
  - I learned a lot from working in this team. They gave me the opportunity to explore tasks I was interested in but did not have a strong foundation in. My favorite task was working on the css of the task list. I am new to CSS, but I enjoyed learning how to integrate CSS with html to create a more visually pleasing website as a whole.
  - I think my group was a little bit behind, but we are making great progress with more mob programming to ensure all components work well together.
- Ivan

  - I’m getting quite a bit out of the class since I didn’t have any Javascript experience before the class. I’m getting exactly what I wanted out of the project. I enjoyed being able to work in a group and not have to do the same type of work constantly. My end goal is a good grade, but I also want a project that I can show off. I think we’ve done the best we can with the way we’ve approached the project, so there’s not much to improve besides very minor details. I’ve enjoyed everything I’ve done, with my most favorite task being the refinement of the application’s style. We seem to be keeping up. The basic overall function of our timer seems to work, regardless of minor bugs.

- Jonathan
  - I'm looking forward to being finished with our website, as we've all been working hard on it and it's been very enjoyable.
  - The project itself was interesting and I enjoyed working as a team. I was hoping to learn what it was like to work on a project with a group and I ended up learning a lot and getting much more experience in GitHub that I will be using in the future.
  - In the end, I hope that we can get a good grade in the class, however, I would still like to create a well-rounded product that I can show others and maybe even use myself.
  - I think that one thing that could have been improved on the app is the uniqueness. However, this is difficult to improve as there are only so many different ways you can represent a Pomodoro timer.
  - I would not want to change the overall design of the timer. I think that the design and overall timer turned out very well. While it may not be the most unique, I think that it still looks very nice.
  - For the work I've done so far, I have enjoyed it a lot. I was able to work on many different parts of the website, through html, js, css. I enjoyed a lot of the work, and was able to get a more solid understanding of how to use different languages to build a website. I think that my favorite task was working on the settings menu as it was deeply involved with html, js, and css. I had to create solutions and bridges between the three languages while working on the settings menu.
  - As a team, I feel that we have been working well as a team so far. Everyone has been doing their part of the work and even if they are not able to finish their assigned work in that week, they do their best to finish it up in the next week. I feel that we might fall a little behind if we keep trying to add different aspects to the project, but overall I have enjoyed the pace and the organization of the team thus far.
