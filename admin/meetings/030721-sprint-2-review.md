# Meeting Outline

## Sprint Review Meeting

- Since it has been two weeks since we started this sprint, this will be our official sprint review meeting
- We will be doing almost everything we normally do, but we want to kind of wrap up the sprint, document the work we have done so far, and discuss the progress we’ve made.
- First, let’s share our progress on last week’s tasks
- We’ll be taking screenshots as people share their work for the sprint review assignment

### Review our work

- First let’s take some time to review what we all did over the last week. Some key details we should each include are:
- What you did
  - Present what you were able to work on! Feel free to share your screen and go into as much detail as you’d like.
  - Summary / Takeaways of your work
  - What you felt you did well / What you struggled with
  - Was this too much work? Not very much?
  - Whether you want to do the same type of thing going forward or try something else out
- We can contribute popcorn style

### Merging our work into a single branch

- Has everyone merged main into their branch?
- If you are ready to merge you code, make a PR for it and we will go in order
- Decide the order depending on people’s progress and who’s ready to merge

### Updating our product backlog

- Let’s check off what we’ve completed in Github Issues
- Let’s reevaluate any bugs that exist
- Let’s examine what we need to do for the statistic tracking to get it functional

## Sprint Retrospective

- Now or on Tuesday?
