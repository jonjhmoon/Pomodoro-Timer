# Meeting Outline:

## Components of a Pomodoro Timer

- We began brainstorming what components might be needed for a Pomodoro Timer. Thanks to everyone who added some ideas!
- Let’s all take a look at the board and look these ideas over:
  - We can go category by category.
  - Each person can explain what they put down, why they put it in that category, and what they hope it would be good for.
- Let’s talk about which features we would want to include for a very basic prototype. Hopefully one we could conceivably get done in a week or so.

## Team Roles

- As we begin to move forward with the project it would be helpful for us all to clarify our role within the project. At the moment we’re an amorphous collective and it’s hard for us to say where we all stand in relation to the project. Hopefully we’ll be able to clarify that today.
- At the moment we are still solidly within the design and research phase of our development process. This means that we aren’t going to box people into javascript programmer or ui designer yet. We all still need to generally contribute to the same types of tasks. But as we get a better idea of where we need to be doing, these notes on each of our roles within the team can help guide who takes which tasks.
- There’s two types of information we need to know so that we can understand our role within the team. We need to know what types of work people are comfortable doing, and how much commitment each of us can give to the project.
  - To do this, we can fill out this spreadsheet. The first set of columns is how comfortable people are with different types of work we’ll need to do. So for example I’m very comfortable in a leadership role, but I’m more uncomfortable with HTML and CSS.
  - The last column is us each reflecting and thinking about how much time we have available for the project this quarter. Some of us might have a lot of other responsibilities and so want to take more of a backseat role. Some of us might be excited to work on this project and so are willing to assume more responsibility in the project. It’s not being a bad teammate to say you have a lot going on and you won’t be able to contribute as much as you might like to. It’s better to be honest now than have to hope that everything just works out.
- Let’s take some time now to fill out our section of the spreadsheet
  - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FewrCc8137FiC2rcWJ2LIIWI-gglKppkgqxqd-BdsF0/edit?usp=sharing
- Now that we’ve all thought about what role we want to play in the project, let’s think about what we want to do over the next week.
  - We’ll want some people to do some research on what a Pomodoro really is, and what people are looking to get out of it.
  - We’ll want some people to think about a visually appealing way to display what components we’ll be making.
  - We’ll want some people to begin prototyping something basic for us.
    - We can divide this up into the different components we were thinking about.

# Meeting Notes:

- Went over the Miro board and discussed everyone’s ideas
- Will decide which components we want to keep later after doing research
- Explained how we will define roles and responsibilities on the team
  - Everyone filled out the form for roles that we can refer to in the future
    Agreed upon the following components for the initial prototype:
  - Start button
  - Stop button
  - Reset button
  - Task list
    - We’re thinking a very simple text box or something equivalent
- Tasks for this week:
  - Ivan: Visual design
  - Ashley: research
  - Arela: visual design
  - Brian: technical
  - Jonathan: visual design
  - Haley: technical
  - Dhanush: technical
  - Jamie: research
- More details on each task was sent in Slack chat and are recorded here:

### Research Task - Jamie, Ashley:

Write up a page or so of notes on what other pomodoro timers exist and what they do, as well as the theory behind pomodoro timers and how they were intended to work.

### Visual Design Task - Ivan, Arela, Jonathan:

Come up with a few rough sketches of what a pomodoro timer app could look like. This could include the various buttons we might want to include as well as the different ways the user might interact with an app. This could be done through Figma, on paper, or any other way of designing it that you could share with the group.

### Basic Prototype - Dhanush, Haley, Brian:

Begin a basic prototype using HTML, CSS, Javascript. Include a Time Display, Start Button, Stop Button, Reset Button, as well as a Simple Task List. You'll hear more from Dhanush.
