# Brainstorming Outline:

## Review our work

- First let’s take some time to review what we all did over the last week. Some key details we should each include are:
- What you did
  - Present what you were able to work on! Feel free to share your screen and go into as much detail as you’d like.
  - Summary / Takeaways of your work
  - What you felt you did well / What you struggled with
  - Was this too much work? Not very much?
  - Whether you want to do the same type of thing going forward or try something else out
- We can contribute popcorn style
- We should all put our work in the specs/brainstorming folder on Github. If you designed something on figma, take a screenshot or convert it to a PDF.

## Updating the Miro board

- Hopefully our work in the past week has given us a new perspective on what our project is going to look like
- Let’s go over to the Miro board to begin updating our overall game plan
  - https://miro.com/welcomeonboard/3tzxsyuhTFIeOAffXHh2pOyRFZ3OcSU2ukFuYh1MTW96LVnQnQSO0fKdQJ3cws6o
- First we can take a look at our feature board.
  - I have a couple new features to add. Depending on what people learned over the week, now you could add stuff as well.
- Hopefully now we can begin to figure out how difficult each of these features would be to implement. Do we want to shift any of the features from one category to another? Dhanush, Haley, and Brian might have the most input on this given the work they’ve done.
  - Do we want to reevaluate what we should include in a very basic prototype? Do we want to aim, higher, lower?
- Next let’s talk about visual design
- Ivan, Arela, Jonathan. What were you thinking about and considering as you made your mockup?
  - Color scheme?
  - Layout of components?
  - Simplicity versus functionality?
- What were our favorite aspects from each of the mockups?
- What type of style and design do we want to aim for with our app?

## User Centered Design Documents

- One part of user centered design we can begin to brainstorm is different user personas
  - http://opendesignkit.org/methods/personas/
  - I’ll share my screen and show off what personas are
- Important for understanding use cases of our app as well as understanding what users might want from our app
- Let’s spend some time and each add an idea for a user to our Miro board, following the steps proposed on the website
  - After 25 minutes we’ll come back with a persona with the different listed traits:
    - Occupation
    - Hobbies
    - Technology familiarity
    - Devices used
    - What do they want to use our timer for?
    - What do they want from our timer?

## Overarching Decisions

- General project plan and approach
  - The professor is pushing for us to eventually end up with an Agile approach to this project.
  - We don’t have to get there right away, but that should probably be the direction we’re moving.
  - This means that we should probably begin to check in more regularly.
    - Not necessarily have a group meeting more often, but we should probably at least start with a midweek checkup where we each make a post about our progress so far in slack
- Gauging how people have felt about our approach to the project so far
  - What have you liked about what we’ve done so far?
  - What would you like us to rethink about what we’ve done so far?
  - What would you like this project to look like in the future?

## Work over the next week

- In the spirit of moving more towards an agile process, let’s aim to each post a check-in post around halfway through the week detailing what we’ve done, any issues we’ve run into, etc.
- In order to keep making headway on our project we still want some people to do exploratory programming / prototyping, some more visual design iterations given the new components we’ve come up with and the new visual style we’re aiming for, and starting to think about high-level system diagrams.
  - If anyone wants to continue with what they were doing this last week, that is great!
  - If anyone wants to change up what they’re doing, that’s good as well.
- Self assigning tasks
  - Exploratory programming / prototyping
    - Trying to do a basic implementation of one or two of the features we made
      - Task list
        - Items on a TODO list
        - Setting a number of pomo sessions for each
        - Marking them done / recording them permanently
      - Timer
        - Different times for each session (25 minutes on, 5 minutes off, longer break after 4 sessions)
        - Sound alerts
  - Iterating on our visual design
    - Trying to integrate our new features and theme into a UI
    - including more of the advanced task-list focused features
    - Maybe moving into multiple pages
  - System diagramming
    - Creating a rough event-based diagram of our app’s functionality
    - Component based diagram, showing how our different features will interact
      - Task list interacting with timer interacting with sounds

# Brainstorming Notes:

## Attendance

- Took place at 4 PM on 1/31/21 through Zoom
- Everyone attended the meeting
  - Brian had to leave a bit early and let us know
    - Might have to get back to him about what he’ll be doing in the upcoming week

## Review our work

- Jamie
  - I made a research document after looking through the wikipedia article for the pomodoro technique and after reading a few websites.
  - I think I got some good information on what types of features we should focus on. I really struggled with my personal time management this week though. I only got my research done a few hours before the meeting. I had a couple midterms which really sapped my time.
  - This was the right amount of work for this week for me, but I think I could handle more work on less busy weeks.
  - I’d be happy to do a bit more research going forward, but I’m also curious to try out some exploratory programming.
- Brian
  - Happy to keep working on the timer stuff
  - Got a basic prototype with some bugs
  - Not too bad time wise
- Haley - Wants to keep working on the code stuff before passing it off - Got a basic prototype with some bugs - Good on time
  -Dhanush - Compiled list of resources - Multiple sounds for user to pick - Can just use local storage for our features - Labels, for different tasks - Did a good amount of research into feasibility - Hard to make something unique - Good amount of work - Open to working on other things - Designing or research
- Ashley
  - Types of data we can collect from pomodoro
    - Number of tasks completed
  - Want to know why user skip a pomodoro
    - Collect distraction data
  - Competitive Audit
    - Looked at very streamlined timer
      - Time and start button are all that stand out
      - Different color themes for working vs break
    - Looked at a focus timer
      - More designed
      - Showed time using dots
      - Task list is weird
      - Has a desktop version
      - A markdown editor with a timer
      - Very unobtrusive design
    - Gamification of the timer
      - Every completed work session gives you a cake
      - Has upper and lower limit for the timer
        - For breaks versus work sessions
  - Want to change it up
  - Good amount of work
- Ivan
  - A lot of timers were very monotone. Not much contrast. Hard to tell where all the buttons are when shrunk down for a mobile device
  - Not colors he’s settled with, but good for contrast
  - Want background that’s easy on eyes and not black or white
  - Timer bigger, compared to other timers
  - Other timers didn’t use space properly. Lots of wasted space
  - Missing a couple components, but tried to get everything
  - Went off of Miro board
  - Think we should minimize the number of secondary windows. Keep it to just one
    - Basic but nice
  - Need a way to delete a task or edit a task
  - Settings it’s inevitable to have another window
  - Could redo where settings and login are
  - Mostly struggled with details
  - Would like some more work
    - To focus on small details
  - Would like to help out with the CSS and javascript if anything
- Arela
  - Made a few designs
  - Not sure how much description people might want to enter for tasks
  - Don’t use timer for much
  - Went off of Ivan’s settings menu
    - Liked long and short break button
  - Played with different colors
    - Liked the colors more contrasting
  - Did well with keeping it simple
  - Not super familiar with how to design stuff, if she spent a bit more time learning
  - Fine amount of work, perfect amount of work
  - Okay with designing more, and programming more
- Jonathan
  - Wanted to make it as minimal as possible
  - Don’t want to spend too much time figuring out what to do
  - Did a simple start/stop button with both functionality on one button
  - Thought of it more as an iOS app
  - Wanted to differentiate with colors a lot
    - Mapping functionality with colors (Green for good, blue for slow down, red for reset)
  - Needed to have a way to add more tasks, but didn’t necessarily want an add button
  - Just somewhere for them to click and enter info
  - Struggled to put content onto the page
    - One of the first time he designed something. Struggled to use the website
  - Did really enjoy the learning process of it. Wants to continue to work on it. But could also help out with other stuff

## Updating the Miro board

- Components of basic prototype:
  - Tasklist delete, clear
  - Number of sessions for each
  - Add in sound after that
- Visual design
  - Added a lot of ideas to the Miro board

Feedback:

- Most people like to have a variation in the color scheme rather than having one or two colors for the whole app
- Need to be aware of text and button colors if using the changing background color as timer goes down
- Like the idea of having everything centered on the page
