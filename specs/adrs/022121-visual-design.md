# Visual Design Decisions

- Status: [accepted]

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to decide the visual design we want to implement for our app based on the various designs we developed.

## Decision Drivers

- Main priority is keeping the design simple and accommodating the user stories we developed

## Considered Options

- Ivan’s Design
- Dhanush’s Design
- Arela’s Design
- Jonathan’s Design

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Ivan’s design, because the color scheme is nice on the eye, and the overall design is simple and easy to implement, as we already have parts of it developed via exploratory programming.

### Positive Consequences

- We avoid wasting time early on with small details and excessive designs for the app, and focus more on having a working first iteration of it.

### Negative Consequences

- The relatively dark background and simplistic displays may not be preferred by some people, as seen in our user stories.

## Reasoning Behind Design Decisions

### Timer Design - Classic Time Display

- Standard design is easy to implement and is already implemented in our current code, which cuts down a lot of time that would be spent on developing a different design
- Some of us really like the countdown timer idea and would like to pursue it if we have time
- But, main priority is to have a fully functional app first, so we will stick to the standard analog timer

### Task List Design

- Haley’s overall design for task list part with Ivan’s color scheme, and add task section will be Ivan’s design
- Fits well with rest of the design decisions (timer, overall color scheme) and Haley has already implemented the backbone of the task list, so not much work is necessary
- Again, we want to finish the first iteration of the app first, so this will save us time on that

### Buttons Design

- Rounded buttons, like Ivan’s design
- Better looking and more unique than the standard rectangular buttons

### Overall Color Scheme

- Ivan’s color scheme, which is a dark blue background, orange and white buttons, and lighter blue for other components
- There was some interest in light blue/pale for the background, but majority voted for dark blue
- Darker color scheme is more visually appealing and fits with the rest of the components better, but will make the dark blue a few shades lighter
  Orange and light blue for other components add good contrast to the background

### Settings Menu

- Ivan’s design
- Simplistic and does the job, and was really the only option we had for this component
